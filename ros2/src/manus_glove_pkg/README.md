## Manus ROS2 Package

This package is provided and created by [**Manus**](https://www.manus-meta.com/).  
We provide this package here for convenience.  
Please refer to the [original documentation](https://docs.manus-meta.com/3.1.0/Plugins/SDK/ROS2/getting%20started/) and contact Manus support for any issues or questions regarding this package.

We include instructions below to install and use the Manus gloves for convenience.  
These are a simplified subset of the official Manus documentation.

### ⚙️ Notes

We make minor adjustments to the original Manus ROS 2 package as documented below:

1. The data frame convention is changed from **Left-Handed** to **Right-Handed** to match ROS 2 standards.  
2. The SDK is configured to use **Integrated Mode only**, as we do not use Remote Mode.
